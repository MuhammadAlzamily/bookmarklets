# BOOKMARKLETS ALL AROUND

I created this repo to document some of the handy bookmarklets i usually write so i'll continue updating it as often as i can :)

## What is a bookmarklet ?

Basically a javascript file that runs when you invoke it, it's similar to a browser extension but it's much easier to make one and it only works when you want it to

## How do i make a bookmarklet ?

- ### for Chrome users

1. Make sure your bookmarks bar is showing as it's much easier to add them that way
2. Right click on the bar then select 'Add page'
3. Pick a name and for the url part just copy any of the scripts in the repo and paste it in the url field

- ### Firefox / other browsers - should work the exact same by just adding a new bookmark and pasting the js in the url field

## How does a bookmarklet exactly work ?

Well since your browser can navigate to a url for example any website you visit
and also run local files for example local developement, it can also run javascript statements so we utilize that feature by telling it "instead of navigating to this url please run this code"

## Current scripts in the repo

`bypass.js` - this bookmarklet helps you bypass the paywall on most news websites and blogs, simply run into a paywall then click the bookmarklet AND BOOM !

`speak.js` - the way this works is, simply select a text by highlighting it with your mouse then press the bookmarklet so it'll read it aloud for you :D

## CONTRIBUTION IS SO MUCH NEEDED

please do share any bookmarklets you've written so it helps this repo grow more and more and hopefully help someone out there with some task

1. fork the repo
2. make a PR
3. your help is beyond welcome
